Given that I am on a patient list
Given that I can see a patient
I should be able to see a 'Remove' button on the bottom right corner of their card
When I click the 'Remove' button
I should be able to see a modal that offers me the option to remove
When I click remove, the patient should be removed from the list
When I search for that patient, that patient should not have the list tag

As a Doctor I need to record Blood Cultures

Given that I am on the patient detail screen
Given that I can see the blood culture panel
When I click the plus icon
It should being up the blood culture set form.

Given that I have added a blood culture set
When I click add isolate
I should be given a form to add an isolate.

Given I have added an Aerobic and a Anaerobic Isolate
The isolates should be ordered by Aerobic then Anaerobic

Given I have added a blood culture set with an Aerobic and a Anaerobic Isolate
Given that I open up the edit model for an isolate and click delete
The isolate I deleted should be removed

Given that I have an added blood culture set with an isolate
When I open up the edit screen for the blood culture set and click delete
The isolate and the set should be removed

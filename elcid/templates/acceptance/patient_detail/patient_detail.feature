As a Doctor
I need to be able to add clinical details to a patient

Given that I am on the detail page of a patient
Given that I can see the Antimicrobials panel
When I should be able to click a plus icon
It should bring up the Anitmicrobial modal
When I fill in the details and press save
It should show me an added Antimicrobial

Given that I am on the detail page of a patient.
Given that I can see an inline clinical advice form
When I fill in the clinical advice form
When I press save
It should add the clinical advice I've entered into the clinical advice timeline

## Adapting elCID for Your Ward

elCID is an implementation of the [OPAL](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) project.

While you might find it helpful as a reference version, and many of the models will be useful, we would suggest that you build your own implementation on top of OPAL rather than forking elCID directly.
Do get in touch (details below) if you would like any help or advice with this - we're always keen to hear from people implementing or considering the project!
